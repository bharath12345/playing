<h1>Movies</h1>

<ul>
    <li>I love non-fiction. And even if they are fictional, I love movies that leave me feeling better about the world and myself - uplifting sortâ€¦</li>
    <li>The order below is completely random. By no means can I rank them.</li>
    <li>These are the movies that I dont mind watching again after every few years&hellip; (there are other movies like Batman that I have liked but I dont carry a strong urge to see them again)</li>
    <li>I do not have a liking for slapstick comedy or horror</li>
