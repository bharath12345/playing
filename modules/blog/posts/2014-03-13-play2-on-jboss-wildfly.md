[JavaEE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Platform,_Enterprise_Edition) (v5 and v6) has a commanding presence in both marketshare and (developer) mindshare in the enterprise software world. The specifications are well thought-out, battle-tested and highly relied upon. I started using JavaEE (v5) way back in 2007 with JBoss 4.x. The latest release, [JavaEE-7](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/tech/index.html), which was released close to a year ago brings with itself a lot of worthy changes to the specs and impl. To bring myself up to speed on it I went through few books and attended a conference (JUDCon, Bangalore). But I have also been coding and acquainting myself with Typesafe's Scala *[reactive](https://typesafe.com/platform)* stack. These two stacks are bound to compete with each more and more in the coming days. However I feel, they can be used in applications in complementary ways when carefully designed. The competition and challenge to JavaEE-7 stems from two tough requirements -

1.  Horizontal scalability
2.  Near real-time persist/process/view of ever increasing data volumes

The JavaEE stack is broadly split into 3 tiers - web, business and persistence. JSF (broadly, including expression-lang, JSTL, JSP and Servlets) is the technology of choice (per the specs) in the web tier. And JSF, to me, seems most vulnerable of *not* being able to raise up to the above mentioned two challenges. JSF does feel like the *loose brick* in the JavaEE stack. And it feel ever more so after spending some time with the [Play Framework](http://www.playframework.com/)!

### Web Tier In JavaEE - *The Loose Brick?*
This was a recent tweet by Peter Thomas -

<a style="float: left; padding-right: 2em" href="https://twitter.com/ptrthomas/statuses/428460021265887232">![image](http://bharathwrites.in/assets/images/peter%20thomas%20tweet.png)</a>

Now to a quick primer on frameworks in JavaEE's web-tier. I like to group the Web Tier of JavaEE applications into 3 groups per a broad grouping of library's goals. A quick note on each of these... 

1. **Component Frameworks**: 
   * Component frameworks like JSF are suited for parts of the application with lot of forms and CRUD operations. JSF is an aggregate of multiple technical pieces which include facelets, expression language, jstl, converters, listeners, validators etc.  JSF helps build composable UI components with server side validation in a scalable way
   * It abstracts away a lot of *state* information in its stack which is not good for building UI components that serve a lot of *read only* and *voluminous* data. Tasks like JSON transformation within JSF are not efficient at scale 
   * Now, rarely do programmers get completely satisfied with the component library within JSF. So they use the richer component frameworks (above and beyond JSF) like Apache Wicket and Tapestry. And for dynamic pages with lot of AJAX there are frameworks like RichFaces and PrimeFaces which provide features atop JSF
2. **Action Frameworks**: For *read-only* and voluminous data handling atop servlets *action* frameworks are preferred which explicitly tie to the HTTP request/response cycle. Action frameworks typically implement the famous MVC pattern for clear separation of concerns. So applications tend to use frameworks like Struts, SpringMVC etc
3. **Standalone, Proprietary Frameworks**: These are the ones that are unbelievably beautiful for quick-small projects and unbelievably ugly for large ones. Technologies like JSP, GWT, Dart et al. These are just *pure evil* from enterprise products perspective

### Play Framework
With me having done quite a bit of programming in JSP and JSF, I found Play to be fresh breath of air. Web application programmers must spend some time reading and understanding [this blog](http://guillaumebort.tumblr.com/post/558830013/why-there-is-no-servlets-in-play) by Guillaume Bort on reasons behind the decision to not write yet another framework atop Java's HttpServlet. My experience with Play has been by building a lookalike for my blog with it (hosted on Heroku [here](http://bharathplays.herokuapp.com)). I have built my blog on NodeJS and RubyRails as well - and honestly, it took much lesser time to build it with Play. But more important is the question of should enterprise web-tiers be programmed with Play? Is Play up to the mark for projects of development scale and complexity? My answer is a thumping YES!!

Let me list the specific features that I found especially useful and important -

* Scala templating with compile time type safety - I have found UI composition to be very intuitive and much simpler than JSF (JSF's composability really feels like a mess when compared with Play!)
* Crisp way to program with Futures and Async to handle action endpoints 
* Websockets - Futures, Async - much better API for streaming data than the WebSocket Spec in JavaEE
* Stateless. Easy to use with Akka
* Marshalling/unmarshalling of JSON data without reflection which provides huge performance improvement
* Explicit, clean server side routing methodology (what a mess this is in JavaEE where programmers often mix annotations, xml and sometimes also bring in client-side routing unnecessarily) 
* No server side sessions at all! Sessions in Play are all made available through cookies and HTTP headers. So no server side context to worry about 
* Built-in build-time JavaScript compilation
* [WebJars](http://www.webjars.org/)
* Less verbose Scala code. The joy of composable functional programming
* Hot deployment during development
* Netty underneath - performance not an issue
* Cloud deployment ready (Heroku, Cloudbees support it)

[This one](http://www.slideshare.net/brikis98/composable-and-streamable-play-apps) is a excellent presentation (and [code](https://github.com/brikis98/ping-play)) by Yevginy Brikman of LinkedIn (LinkedIn uses Play! for multiple web apps in its stack). The title is apt - building web apps that are composable and streamable. More and more, enterprise applications have UI requirements of the kind described here. And building these using JSF/Java would be too complex a web project and IMHO not worth the trouble!    

### HOWTO - Play2 on Wildfly to interop with JavaEE
For very good reasons enterprise applications are generally hosted on application containers. And application containers mostly come built with a servlet container for web frontend. Now since Play2 is not Servlet based does it mean using it in enterprise applications straightaway get vetoed? Not necessarily. If engineers have a little chutzpah, the gap can be bridged. Here is how I was able to host my Play2 application on JBoss-Wildfly -

1. The plugin to study and use for the task is the [Play2War](https://github.com/dlecan/play2-war-plugin). Play2War builds a WAR out of a Play2 application. I was then able to deploy this WAR of my Play app on Wildfly and get it to work
2. After following the usage/configuration instructions from the Play2War's GitHub page, the first thing to do is to configure the *excludes*. A number of JARs that get packaged using Play2War clash with JBoss's modules and thus need to be excluded. Here is a quick list of such JAR's from my project -

   </table>

   One can see from the above table that versions of many artefacts is newer in Wildfly. I decided to use the newer Wildfly versions and exclude these from the WAR generated by Play2War. So included this filtering statement in my project's *build.sbt* file -

   <pre>Play2WarKeys.filteredArtifacts ++= Seq(
  ("com.google.guava", "guava"),
  ("com.google.code.findbugs", "findbugs"),
  ("com.fasterxml.jackson.core","jackson-annotations"),
  ("com.fasterxml.jackson.core","jackson-core"),
  ("com.fasterxml.jackson.core","jackson-databind"),
  ("com.fasterxml","classmate"),
  ("commons-codec","commons-codec"),
  ("commons-io","commons-io"),
  ("org.hibernate","hibernate-commons-annotations"),
  ("org.hibernate","hibernate-core"),
  ("org.hibernate","hibernate-entitymanager"),
  ("org.hibernate","hibernate-validator"),
  ("org.hibernate.common","hibernate-commons-annotations"),
  ("org.hibernate.javax.persistence","hibernate-jpa-2.0-api"),
  ("javax.validation","validation-api"),
  ("javax.persistence","persistence-api"),
  ("javax.transaction","transaction-api"),
  ("org.jboss.spec.javax.transaction","jboss-transaction-api_1.1_spec"),
  ("org.jboss.logging","jboss-logging"),
  ("org.jboss.logmanager", "log4j-jboss-logmanager"),
  ("org.springframework","spring-beans"),
  ("org.springframework","spring-context"),
  ("org.springframework","spring-core"),
  ("postgresql","postgresql"),
  ("org.javassist","javassist"),

  ("dom4j","dom4j"),
  ("tyrex","tyrex")
  //("com.jolbox", "bonecp"),
  //("io.netty","netty"),
)</pre>

3. Next thing to do is to use a jboss-deployment-structure.xml where one can specify the newer Wildfly modules of these artefacts to be used for the deployment. This deployment descriptor should be created in the following path in the Play2 project -
   <pre>
   app/
   conf/
   project/
   war/
   |--WEB-INF
         |--jboss-deployment-structure.xml
   </pre>
   
   I used the following setting in this xml -
   <pre>
    &lt;jboss-deployment-structure>
      &lt;deployment>
        &lt;dependencies>
          &lt;module name="com.google.guava"/>
          &lt;module name="com.fasterxml.jackson.core.jackson-annotations"/>
          &lt;module name="com.fasterxml.jackson.core.jackson-core"/>
          &lt;module name="com.fasterxml.jackson.core.jackson-databind"/>
          &lt;!--module name="com.h2database.h2"/-->
          &lt;module name="org.apache.commons.codec"/>
          &lt;module name="org.apache.commons.io"/>
          &lt;!--module name="io.netty"/-->
          &lt;module name="org.hibernate.commons-annotations"/>
          &lt;module name="org.hibernate"/>
          &lt;module name="org.javassist"/>
          &lt;module name="org.jboss.logging"/>
          &lt;module name="org.yaml.snakeyaml"/>
          &lt;module name="org.antlr"/>
          &lt;module name="org.dom4j"/>
          &lt;module name="org.postgres"/>
          &lt;module name="javax.validation.api"/>
          &lt;module name="javax.persistence.api"/>
          &lt;module name="javax.transaction.api"/>
          &lt;module name="org.glassfish.javaeetutorial.helloservice-api"/>
          &lt;module name="org.jboss.log4j.logmanager"/>
        &lt;/dependencies>
      &lt;/deployment>
    &lt;/jboss-deployment-structure>
  </pre>

4. I wanted to use Hibernate in my Play project. And I wanted to interact with EJB's and ActiveMQ messaging service in Wildfly. Firstly, this is very much possible. To use hibernate, one has to create the persistence.xml in the following structure -
   <pre>
   war
   |--WEB-INF
         |--classes
               |--META-INF
                    |--persistence.xml
   </pre>
   
   Since the WAR will be deployed in Wildfly, make sure to read the persistence related docs from its wiki.
5. Logging - Play2War's GitHub wiki has a separate section for configuring logging with Wildfly. Make sure to read that. It basically asks for including this dependency in the build.sbt -
   <pre>
   "com.github.play2war.ext"   %% "redirect-playlogger"     % "1.0.1"
   </pre>
6. With this configuration the WAR built by Play2War for my Play2 project was around 50MB in size. One has to use JNDI lookup to access the EJB's in container. The looked up EJB's can be cached in a Scala Object to avoid repeats
7. One shortcoming that I realised while doing this work was that **websockets will not work** in this setup. Play2 uses Netty as is HTTP server and Wildfly uses Undertow. The websocket implementation in Wildfly (per the Websocket 1.0 spec) could be closely tied to to Undertow - but I have not read Wildfly's code to say so with certainty. Or maybe if one can make Wildfly to use Netty instead of Undertow as the underlying HTTP server then the websocket communication as provided by Play2 should become naturally available. Anyway, this is one shortcoming one has to put up if one takes this route

*The Final Word* - I really feel Play2 will be a really good fit even in the JavaEE stack a few years down the line when some more bridges will appear around it to make it easily compatible to JavaEE application servers. It can be done even now as I found out. However one should take this plunge very cautiously (at least when using Wildfly). But to me, this is the right way to go... and the right way is generally never easy!
