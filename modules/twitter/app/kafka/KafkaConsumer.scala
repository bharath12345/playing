  * chroot path as part of it's zookeeper connection string which puts its data under some path in the global zookeeper namespace. 
  * If so the consumer should use the same chroot path in its connection string. For example to give a chroot path of /chroot/path

  * What to do when there is no initial offset in Zookeeper or if an offset is out of range: 
  * 1) smallest : automatically reset the offset to the smallest offset 
  * 2) largest : automatically reset the offset to the largest offset 
  * 3) anything else: throw exception to the consumer. If this is set to largest, the consumer may lose some 
       messages when the number of partitions, for the topics it subscribes to, changes on the broker. 

  ****************************************************************************************
  To prevent data loss during partition addition, set auto.offset.reset to smallest

  This make sense to change to true if you know you are listening for new data only as of
  after you connect to the stream new things are coming out.  you can audit/reconcile in
  another consumer which this flag allows you to toggle if it is catch-up and new stuff or
  just new stuff coming out of the stream.  This will also block waiting for new stuff so
  it makes a good listener.
