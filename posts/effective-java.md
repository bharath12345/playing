I read this beautifully written article a few days ago - "[I will not do your tech interview](https://medium.com/lessons-learned/80ba19c55883)". I can't agree more with the author. Every single time I have had to give/take a technical interview, more than the sense of being inadequately prepared I feel like carrying an inexplicable psychological burden. And I have met no one who does not fear what Ellis beautifully calls as - *"bear-trap of a stupid brainteaser"* :-).

In the years to come, internet is definitely going to give more and more relief to competent engineers. Having a GitHub repository with a dump of one's pet technology prototypes, having a StackOverflow point score, well articulated tweets and maybe even well-written technology blog (read [this](http://nathanmarz.com/blog/break-into-silicon-valley-with-a-blog-1.html) by Nathan Marz) will pay dividends to engineers continuously at work to sharpen their axe…

But then, my current reality is a reality. And I have to take technical interviews as part of my job. And hiring the right people is so much more important for a small company - many times it is the only differentiator between success and failure of the company itself. So with the job's being dished out being so important, technical interviews are not supposed to be easy. Both for the interviewee and the interviewer. Pressed into the interviewing job, I felt the need to brush-up my fundamentals. This post is from my re-read of Joshua Bloch's classic - "[Effective Java](http://www.amazon.com/Effective-Java-Edition-Joshua-Bloch/dp/0321356683)" - from a interviewer's perspective… trying to quickly refresh the elementary concepts to myself. It aint coherent or complete… will keep adding stuff to this post over time as I realise what questions really make the cut. There are plenty of *interview-questions* blogs and books out there - but I felt, instead of quizzing a candidate on some corner case of the JVM or language (which many times the interviewer himself might have realised just hours before the interview), it would be more honest/ethical on my part to quiz in what are well-known and real-world areas of programming for an aspiring engineer - and 'Effective Java' is precisely the guide for such a setting…

Now planning to write few more blogs like these in the days to come… one surely on Design Patterns by GoF. Maybe one on JavaScript's good parts per Doughlas Crockford. And time permitting, few more…

        <div class="col-md-10 left">
        <h5>1. Does Cloneable interface have a clone() method? Why not?</h5>
        Because the Java Object's clone() method (which is protected) is supposed to be used
        <h5>2. How does Java Object's clone() method work?</h5>
        If a class implements Cloneable, Object’s clone method returns a field-by-field copy of the object; otherwise it throws CloneNotSupportedException
        <h5>3. What are the 3 rules for implementing Cloneable?</h5>
            a. x.clone() != x
            b. x.clone().getClass() == x.getClass()
            c. x.clone().equals(x)
        <h5>4. How to clone properly?</h5>
        All classes that implement Cloneable should override clone with a public method whose return type is the class itself. This method should first call super.clone and then fix any fields that need to be fixed. Typically, this means copying any mutable objects that comprise the internal “deep structure” of the object being cloned, and replacing the clone’s references to these objects with ref- erences to the copies. While these internal copies can generally be made by call- ing clone recursively, this is not always the best approach. If the class contains only primitive fields or references to immutable objects, then it is probably the case that no fields need to be fixed.
        <h5>5. How come interfaces like Cloneable and Serializable have no methods? Why do they exist at all then? How does JVM use them?</h5>
        The UID and custom readers/writers are accessed via reflection.
        Serializable serves as a marker to the JRE/JVM, which may take action(s) based on its presence. Refer to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marker_interface_pattern. An example of the application of marker interfaces from the Java programming language is the Serializable interface. A class implements this interface to indicate that its non-transient data members can be written to an ObjectOutputStream. The ObjectOutputStream private method writeObject() contains a series of instanceof tests to determine writeability, one of which looks for the Serializable interface. If any of these tests fails, the method throws a NotSerializableException.

                <li class="list-group-item">d. local classes</li>
            </ul>

<h5>2. When will you make a nested class static?</h5>
If an instance of a nested class can exist in isolation from an instance of its enclosing class, then the nested class must be a static member class: it is impossible to create an instance of a nonstatic member class without an enclosing instance. If you declare a member class that does not require access to an enclosing instance, always put the static modifier in its declaration

<h5>3. Why would one prefer static classes?</h5>
The association between a nonstatic member class instance and its enclosing instance is established when the former is created; it cannot be modified thereafter. Storing this reference costs time and space, and can result in the enclosing instance being retained when it would otherwise be eligible for garbage collection

        <div class="col-md-10 left">
<h5>1. If Sub is a subtype of Super, then is the array Sub[] a subtype of Super[]?</h5>
Yes. Arrays are covariant. Lists are invariant
<h5>2. So which one is better? And why?</h5>
Lists are better. Arrays are reified. This means that arrays know and enforce their element types at runtime. Generics, by contrast, are implemented by erasure. This means that they enforce their type constraints only at compile time and discard (or erase) their element type information at runtime.
<h5>3. Test question -</h5>
This code fragment is legal but fails at runtime! -
                  <pre>
                  Object[] objectArray = new Long[1];
                  objectArray[0] = "I don't fit in"; // Throws ArrayStoreException</pre>
                  But this one wont compile at all! -
                  <pre>List&lt;Object&gt; ol = new ArrayList&lt;Long&gt;(); // Incompatible types ol.add("I don't fit in");</pre>
<h5>4. Are these legal?</h5>
<pre>new List&lt;E&gt;[]
new List&lt;String&gt;[]
new E[]</pre>
No. It is illegal to create an array of a generic type, a parameterized type, or a type parameter. Types such as E, List&lt;E&gt;, and List<String> are technically known as non-reifiable types. Intuitively speaking, a non-reifiable type is one whose runtime representation contains less information than its compile-time representation.

<h5>3. When would you throw a runtime exception?</h5>

<h5>4. When would you throw a error?</h5>
         there is a strong convention that errors are reserved for use by the JVM to indicate resource defi- ciencies, invariant failures, or other conditions that make it impossible to continue execution. Given the almost universal acceptance of this convention, it’s best not to implement any new Error subclasses. Therefore, all of the unchecked throw- ables you implement should subclass RuntimeException

<h5>1. Is writing of all primitive data types atomic in Java?</h5>
        reading or writing a variable is atomic unless the variable is of type long or double
<h5>2. How long would you expect this program to run?</h5>
        <pre>
        public class StopThread {
               private static boolean stopRequested;
               public static void main(String[] args)
                       throws InterruptedException {
                   Thread backgroundThread = new Thread(new Runnable() {
                       public void run() {
                           int i = 0;
                           while (!stopRequested)
                                i++;
                       }
                   });
                   backgroundThread.start();
                   TimeUnit.SECONDS.sleep(1);
                   stopRequested = true;
               }
        }</pre>
        Probably permanently. The VM might do what is called hoisting, the virtual machine might transform this code:
        <pre>
        while (!done)
            i++;</pre>
        into this code:
        <pre>
        if (!done)
            while (true)
                i++;</pre>
        How would you correct his?

<h5>3. Is this program thread safe? Can generateSerialNumber() be called from multiple threads safely?</h5>
        <pre>
        private static volatile int nextSerialNumber = 0;
           public static int generateSerialNumber() {
               return nextSerialNumber++;
        }</pre>

<h5>4. What are the 4 factors that need trade-off when writing multi-threaded concurrent programs?</h5>
        Safety, Liveness, Efficiency, Reusability

<h5>5. Whats the tradeoff between Safety and Liveness?</h5>
        safety: nothing bad happens
        liveness: something good eventually happens

<h5>6. What is reentracy? Is Java reentrant?</h5>
        Yes

<h5>7. Whats the difference between ArrayList and CopyOnWriteArrayList?</h5>
        It is a variant of ArrayList in which all write operations are implemented by making a fresh copy of the entire underlying array. Because the internal array is never modified, iteration requires no locking and is very fast. For most uses, the performance of CopyOnWriteArrayList would be atrocious, but it’s perfect for observer lists, which are rarely modified and often traversed.

#### Serialization
<div class="bs-docs-grid">
    <div class="row show-grid">
        <div class="col-md-2 right">Implement serializable judiciously</div>
        <div class="col-md-10 left">
<h5>1. What is serialVersionUID?</h5>
 Every serializable class has a unique identification number associated with it. If you do not specify this number explicitly by declaring a static final long field named serialVersionUID, the system automatically generates it at runtime by applying a complex procedure to the class. The automatically generated value is affected by the class’s name, the names of the interfaces it implements, and all of its public and protected members. If you change any of these things in any way, for example, by adding a trivial convenience method, the automatically generated serial version UID changes. If you fail to declare an explicit serial version UID, compatibility will be broken, resulting in an InvalidClassException at runtime. If no serial version UID is provided, an expensive computation is required to generate one at runtime. If you ever want to make a new version of a class that is incompatible with existing versions, merely change the value in the serial version UID declaration.

<h5>2. Why should a class be made to implement Serilizable with caution?</h5>
 A major cost of implementing Serializable is that it decreases the flexibility to change a class’s implementation once it has been released.

        <div class="col-md-2 right">Consider using a custom serialized form</div>
        <div class="col-md-10 left">
<h5>How good is Java's ObjectStream based Serialization? When would you implement your own custom serialized form?</h5>
        The default serialized form of an object is a reasonably efficient encoding. The default serialized form is likely to be appropriate if an object’s phys- ical representation is identical to its logical content. Drawbacks - can be excessive in space consumption, not very fast, it permanently ties the exported API to the current internal representation
